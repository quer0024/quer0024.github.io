                My name is Maya Querido. I grew up in downtown Ottawa with my younger brother and my parents. I went to Elgin Street Public School for elementary, Glashan Public School for middle school and Lisgar Collegiate Institute for high school. I have always been interested in art, sports, and music. I took a gap year where I got to work full time and do a bit of traveling, and now I attend Algonquin College.
