            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Maya Querido. I grew up in downtown Ottawa with my younger brother and my parents. I went to Elgin Street Public School for elementary, Glashan Public School for middle school and Lisgar Collegiate Institute for high school. I have always been interested in art, sports, and music. I took a gap year where I got to work full time and do a bit of traveling, and now I attend Algonquin College.

                I'm currently in my 1st year in the Interactive Media Design Program at Algonquin. I've always enjoyed using the Adobe Creative Cloud programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I've also developed an interested in Web Development, despit being weary of the class when applying. I hope this program will give me the experience to work in UX Design in the future. Thanks for reading!
